## Exercises

Here is a list of some of the exercises included in this repository:

1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   Learn how to clean, normalize, and preprocess datasets.

2. **Linear Regression**  
   Build a simple linear regression model to predict continuous outcomes.

3. **Classification Algorithms**  
   Implement classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.

4. **Clustering**  
   Work with unsupervised learning techniques such as K-Means clustering.

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   Evaluate model performance using techniques like cross-validation, confusion matrices, and ROC curves.

Each exercise folder contains a detailed Jupyter notebook explaining the steps, along with the required datasets.
