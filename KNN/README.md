# K-NEAREST NEIGHBOURS

## Objective: 
The objective of this assignment is to implement and evaluate the K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm for classification using the given datasets.

## Dataset:
Need to classify the animal type.

## Tasks:

### 1. Data Analysis:
- Analyze the data using visualizations.

### 2. Data Preprocessing:
- Handle missing values and outliers, if any.

### 3. Data Splitting:
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).

### 4. K-Nearest Neighbours Implementation:
- Implement the K-Nearest Neighbours algorithm using a machine learning library like scikit-learn on the training dataset.

### 5. Distance Metric and K Value:
- Choose an appropriate distance metric and value for K.

### 6. Performance Evaluation:
- Evaluate the classifier's performance on the testing set using the following metrics:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score

### 7. Decision Boundary Visualization:
- Visualize the decision boundaries of the classifier.

## Interview Questions:
1. What are the key hyperparameters in KNN?
2. What distance metrics can be used in KNN?
