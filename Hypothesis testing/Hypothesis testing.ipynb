    "\n",
    "- Bombay Hospitality Ltd. operates a franchise model for producing exotic Norwegian dinners throughout New England.\n",
    "- The operating cost for a franchise in a week (W) is given by the equation `W = $1,000 + $5X`, where X represents the number of units produced in a week.\n",
    "- Recent feedback from restaurant owners suggests that this cost model may no longer be accurate, as their observed weekly operating costs are higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "- To investigate the restaurant owners' claim about the increase in weekly operating costs using hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Provided**\n",
