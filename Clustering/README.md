# CLUSTERING ANALYSIS

## Understanding and Implementing K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN Algorithms

### Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to introduce various clustering algorithms, including K-Means, hierarchical, and DBSCAN, and provide hands-on experience in applying these techniques to a real-world dataset.

### Datasets:
- [Insert dataset details or link here]

### Data Preprocessing:
1. **Handle Missing Values**: Identify and address any missing values in the dataset.
2. **Remove Outliers**: Detect and remove any outliers that may skew the results.
3. **Scale Features**: Normalize or standardize features if necessary to ensure fair comparisons.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Perform EDA to gain insights into the distribution of data and identify potential clusters.
- Use multiple visualizations (e.g., histograms, box plots, pair plots) to understand hidden patterns in the dataset.

### Implementing Clustering Algorithms:
- Implement the K-Means, hierarchical, and DBSCAN algorithms using a programming language such as Python with libraries like scikit-learn or MATLAB.
- Apply each clustering algorithm to the pre-processed dataset to identify clusters within the data.
- Experiment with different parameter settings:
  - **Hierarchical Clustering**: Test various linkage criteria.
  - **K-Means**: Use the Elbow method to determine optimal K values.
  - **DBSCAN**: Adjust parameters such as epsilon and minPts to evaluate clustering results.

### Cluster Analysis and Interpretation:
- Analyze the clusters generated by each clustering algorithm.
- Interpret the characteristics of each cluster and write insights in a few comments.

### Visualization:
- Visualize the clustering results using scatter plots or other suitable visualization techniques.
- Plot the clusters with different colors to visualize the separation of data points belonging to different clusters.

### Evaluation and Performance Metrics:
- Evaluate the quality of clustering using internal evaluation metrics such as the silhouette score for K-Means and DBSCAN.
