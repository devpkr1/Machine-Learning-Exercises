# Comparing LightGBM and XGBoost Algorithms Using the Titanic Dataset

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to compare the performance of LightGBM and XGBoost algorithms using the Titanic dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 1. Load the Titanic Dataset
- Load the Titanic dataset using Python's pandas library.

### 2. Check for Missing Values
- Identify and check for missing values in the dataset.

### 3. Explore Data Distributions
- Visualize data distributions using histograms and box plots.

### 4. Visualize Relationships
- Visualize relationships between features and survival using scatter plots and bar plots.

## Data Preprocessing

### 1. Impute Missing Values
- Impute missing values using appropriate methods (e.g., mean, median, mode, or advanced imputation techniques).

### 2. Encode Categorical Variables
- Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding as necessary.

### 3. Additional Preprocessing
- If needed, apply more preprocessing methods on the given dataset (e.g., feature scaling, outlier removal).

## Building Predictive Models

### 1. Split the Dataset
- Split the preprocessed dataset into training and testing sets.

### 2. Choose Evaluation Metrics
- Select appropriate evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) for model evaluation.

### 3. Build Predictive Models
- Build predictive models using LightGBM and XGBoost algorithms.

### 4. Train and Evaluate Models
- Train the models on the training set and evaluate their performance on the testing set.

### 5. Optimize Model Performance
- Use techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.

## Comparative Analysis

### 1. Compare Performance Metrics
- Compare the performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) of LightGBM and XGBoost models.

### 2. Visualize and Interpret Results
- Visualize and interpret the results to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.

## Submission Requirements
- Well-commented code explaining each step of the analysis.
- Visualizations with appropriate titles and labels.
- A brief report summarizing the comparative analysis results and practical implications.
