======================

**Objective**
------------

The objective of this assignment is to introduce students to rule mining techniques, particularly focusing on market basket analysis and provide hands-on experience.

**Dataset**
------------

* Use the Online retail dataset to apply the association rules.

**Data Preprocessing**
----------------------

* Pre-process the dataset to ensure it is suitable for Association rules, this may include:

	+ Converting the data to appropriate format

**Association Rule Mining**
---------------------------

* Implement an Apriori algorithm using tools like Python with libraries such as Pandas and Mlxtend etc.
* Apply association rule mining techniques to the pre-processed dataset to discover interesting relationships between products purchased together.
* Set appropriate threshold for:
	+ Support
	+ Confidence
	+ Lift to extract meaningful rules.

**Analysis and Interpretation**
------------------------------

* Analyze the generated rules to identify interesting patterns and relationships between the products.
* Interpret the results and provide insights into customer purchasing behavior based on the discovered rules.

**Interview Questions**
