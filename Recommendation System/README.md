# Recommendation System for Anime Dataset

## Data Description
- **Unique ID**: Identifier for each anime.
- **Anime Title**: Title of the anime.
- **Broadcast Type**: Type of broadcast (e.g., TV, OVA).
- **Genre**: Genre of the anime.
- **Number of Episodes**: Total episodes of each anime.
- **Average Rating**: Average rating for each anime compared to the number of users who rated it.
- **Number of Community Members**: Total community members for each anime.

## Objective
The objective of this assignment is to implement a recommendation system using cosine similarity on an anime dataset.

## Dataset
Use the Anime Dataset which contains information about various anime, including their titles, genres, number of episodes, and user ratings.

## Tasks

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Load the Dataset**: Import the dataset into a suitable data structure (e.g., pandas DataFrame).
- **Handle Missing Values**: Check for and handle any missing values in the dataset.
- **Explore the Dataset**: Understand the structure and attributes of the dataset.

### 2. Feature Extraction
- **Decide on Features**: Identify the features that will be used for computing similarity (e.g., genres, user ratings).
- **Convert Categorical Features**: If necessary, convert categorical features into numerical representations (e.g., one-hot encoding for genres).
- **Normalize Numerical Features**: Normalize numerical features if required to ensure they are on a similar scale.

### 3. Recommendation System
- **Design a Recommendation Function**: Create a function to recommend anime based on cosine similarity.
- **Recommend Similar Anime**: Given a target anime, recommend a list of similar anime based on cosine similarity scores.
- **Experiment with Threshold Values**: Adjust the recommendation list size by experimenting with different threshold values for similarity scores.

### 4. Evaluation
- **Split the Dataset**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets for evaluation.
- **Evaluate the Recommendation System**: Use appropriate metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the performance of the recommendation system.
- **Analyze Performance**: Analyze the performance of the recommendation system and identify areas for improvement.

## Interview Questions
1. **Can you explain the difference between user-based and item-based collaborative filtering?**
   - User-based collaborative filtering recommends items based on the preferences of similar users, while item-based collaborative filtering recommends items based on the similarities between items themselves.

2. **What is collaborative filtering, and how does it work?**
   - Collaborative filtering is a method used in recommendation systems that relies on user-item interactions. It works by identifying patterns in user behavior and leveraging the preferences of similar users or items to generate recommendations.
