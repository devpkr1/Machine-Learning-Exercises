# DECISION TREE

## Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to apply Decision Tree Classification to a given dataset, analyze the performance of the model, and interpret the results.

## Tasks:

### 1. Data Preparation:
- Load the dataset into your preferred data analysis environment (e.g., Python with libraries like Pandas and NumPy).

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the structure of the dataset.
- Check for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the data.
- Visualize the distribution of features using:
  - Histograms
  - Box plots
  - Correlation matrices

### 3. Feature Engineering:
- If necessary, perform feature engineering techniques such as:
  - Encoding categorical variables
  - Scaling numerical features
  - Handling missing values

### 4. Decision Tree Classification:
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., using an 80-20 split).
- Implement a Decision Tree Classification model using a library like scikit-learn.
- Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance on the testing set using appropriate evaluation metrics such as:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
  - ROC-AUC

### 5. Hyperparameter Tuning:
- Perform hyperparameter tuning to optimize the Decision Tree model.
- Experiment with different hyperparameters such as:
  - Maximum depth
  - Minimum samples split
  - Criterion

### 6. Model Evaluation and Analysis:
- Analyze the performance of the Decision Tree model using the evaluation metrics obtained.
- Visualize the decision tree structure to understand the rules learned by the model and identify important features.

## Interview Questions:
1. What are some common hyperparameters of decision tree models, and how do they affect the model's performance?
2. What is the difference between Label Encoding and One-hot Encoding?
