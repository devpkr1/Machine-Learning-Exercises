# Support Vector Machine Analysis on Mushroom Dataset

## Dataset Selection
For this assignment, we'll utilize the widely recognized Mushroom Dataset.

## Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 1. Load the Mushroom Dataset
- Load the dataset using appropriate libraries (e.g., pandas) and perform fundamental data exploration.

### 2. Visualize Feature Distributions
- Utilize histograms, box plots, or density plots to understand feature distributions.

### 3. Investigate Feature Correlations
- Analyze feature correlations to discern relationships within the data.

## Task 2: Data Preprocessing

### 1. Encode Categorical Variables
- Encode categorical variables if necessary (e.g., using one-hot encoding or label encoding).

### 2. Split the Dataset
- Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to prepare for model training and evaluation.

## Task 3: Data Visualization

### 1. Visualize Feature Distributions and Relationships
- Employ scatter plots, pair plots, or relevant visualizations to comprehend feature distributions and relationships.

### 2. Visualize Class Distributions
- Visualize class distributions to gauge dataset balance or imbalance.

## Task 4: SVM Implementation

### 1. Implement SVM Classifier
- Implement a basic SVM classifier using Python libraries like scikit-learn.

### 2. Train the SVM Model
- Train the SVM model on the training data.

### 3. Evaluate Model Performance
- Evaluate model performance on the testing data using appropriate metrics such as:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score

## Task 5: Visualization of SVM Results

### 1. Visualize Classification Results
